    <strong>Colleen C.</strong>:
    <blockquote>"Madison is the trainer that you always wished for.  No stock routine for her! She tailored my workout to accommodate my knee rehab needs, but also worked to strengthen —and balance— my whole body. Tough when she needs to be, and smart and creative about everything from muscular-skeletal to nutrition."</blockquote>

    <strong>Diane H.</strong>:
    <blockquote>"I began exercising with a personal trainer in fancy club in NYC 30 years ago.  Since then I have worked with several personal trainers. Madison has been the best: she is always prepared, customizes challenging workouts for me and brings with her a scholar's knowledge of what exercises I need to achieve results.  I have enjoyed exercising for the first time in my life.  I know it's because of Madison!"</blockquote>
