    My name is Madison Senior and I am a NASM certified personal trainer at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY. Since 2013, I have been working on developing my skills as a trainer and have a passion for helping others in and out of the gym through both personal training and group fitness classes. Born and raised in Tampa, Florida, I plan on returning to the sunshine state upon graduation in 2015 to continue my education within the health and fitness industry.
