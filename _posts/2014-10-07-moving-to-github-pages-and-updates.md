I've made the move to GitHub pages to lower the barrier it takes to add content on here. I can now add and edit new posts on GitHub and have it automatically build the static content for me. It wasn't *too* bad before, but this way is much easier.

## A very high level overview of my life since May 9th 2014 (the last post date on this site)

### May 2014

My final month at [Urban4m](http://www.urban4m.com/).

Car packed and ready to head back to Blacksburg, VA

### Summer 2014

Moved into my new townhouse. Without air conditioning it was a bit rough.

I got back my previous student job position at [STL](www.stl.vt.edu).

### Fall 2014

Not much to say about school. Here is a photo of Burruss Hall I took in September.

## The Future

### Posts

New posts should come once a week. They will stick with the current theme of programming & food creations.

Comment sections will come once I finish my [recomm](https://github.com/trevorsenior/recomm) project.

### Site design

This site is currently using the default Jekyll 2.2.0 theme. I like how it's minimal, but the home page is a bit cluttered with the post listings. I'll move it into its own dedicated "Posts" link next to the "About" one, and figure out what to do with the homepage later.

Maybe the Homepage will just be my Gravatar image.
