This is the first post in a series of any rice noodles that I deem worthy. This one in particular resembles Pad Thai.

 - Bean sprouts (to taste)
 - Green cabbage
 - Lemons (2)
 - Cilantro

#### Protein

 - Eggs (2 per serving, more on this later)
 - Meat of choice (I mean, if you want. I used beef)

#### Other

 - Soy Sauce (to taste)
 - Fish Sauce (to taste)
 - Rice Vinegar (to taste)

### Get a...

 - Wok.
 - Pot to boil water in (optionally, use a water boiler).
 - Bowl/Pot to soak noodles in.
 - Bowl to pickle some veggies in.
 - Bowl/Pot to hold the "Base" when not in use (more on this later)
 - Cooking utensils - I just used a fork, chef's knife, and a spoon for tasting.

## Cook

### Noodles #1

Get some water boiling for the noodles, we'll come back to noodle prep later.

### Base #1

This step is where all the heat comes from, change as needed.

 1. Wok on pan. Add some veggie oil. Medium heat.
 2. Thinly slice garlic (or chop into bits, whatever works).
 3. Slice both of the jalapeño's, but **note** - you need to keep one for the next step.
 4. Slice the other two peppers of choice.
 4. Chop your ginger into tiny pieces - you can keep the outer skin on it if you want.
 4. Throw the peppers (remember only **one** jalapeño), garlic, and ginger into the oil. Go ahead and throw some chopped carrots in there as well because why not.

The pan shouldn't be too hot else you will burn the garlic. Keep an eye on it as you move on to the other steps

### Pickled Veggies #1

 1. Chop half of the cabbage into larger chunks (one inch squares). Then chop some cabbage as thin as you can (1/8 of a cabbage?).
 3. Chop your green onions. I like to keep them in fairly large chunks, but do as you wish.
 4. Throw the **thinly chopped** cabbage, the rest of the sliced jalapeño, green onions, and some bean sprouts into a bowl. (We will use the rest of the cabbage later)
 5. Add some sliced carrots as well because you can.
 5. Add a some rice vinegar (just enough to coat the veggies in the bowl).
 6. Add a little bit of soy sauce. 
 7. Add a bit of black pepper.
 8. Roll a lemon, and squeeze it in.
 9. Mix until everything is coated and set aside.

What mine looked like:

### Base #2

Your place should be smelling pretty great right about now, but it's time to take it further.

 1. Turn the heat to medium high.
 2. Stir the mixture until you just start to notice that the garlic is becoming a touch brown.
 3. Add about a cup of your white wine (guesstimate?)
 4. Add a little bit of dark soy sauce (careful, it's powerful stuff)
 5. Add about 1/2 cup (?) of soy sauce or until the mixture is darkish.
 6. Throw in some fish sauce to taste.
 7. Throw in some rice vinegar to taste.
 8. Add about 1/4 cup (?) of brown sugar.
 9. Finely chop about 1/4 (?) cup peanuts (you can also crush them as well). Add them in.
 10. Stir. 

Keep an eye out for it starting to bubble up / thickening. If this happens before you get to "Base #3" take if off the heat.

### Noodles #2

At this point your water should be boiling or close enough. Pour the hot water into the bowl of rice noodles and let sit till we reach "Noodles #3". 

Keep an eye out on the noodles. If they over soak they will be too soft to incorporate into the dish. Drain them earlier if needed.

<sub>Totally forgot to watch the noodles and wasted a bunch of them.</sub>


### Base #3 

Keep stirring the mixture until it's thick and bubbling up. You should also be taste testing during this phase to make sure it's how you like it. Add more soy sauce, vinegar, etc. until it's perfection.

Once thick and bubbly, move the mixture (peppers, garlic, ginger, ...) from the wok into a bowl/pot.


### Cabbage #1

Now you have an empty wok with bits from "Base #3".

 1. Lower heat back down to medium
 2. Throw the roughly chopped cabbage into the wok.
 3. Throw some carrots into the wok - why not.
 4. Throw some soy sauce into the wok.
 5. Add some black pepper into the wok.
 6. Stir, adding more soy sauce as needed to prevent burning.

Once the water starts leaving the veggies and it starts to steam move on to the next step

### Base #4

 1. Slice the meat of choice into thin chunks.
 2. Add meat to the bowl/pot that you added the thick and bubbly mixture to.
 3. Roll and squeeze the juice of a lemon into the mixture.
 4. Mix the meat in with the mixture - it'll start to cook in there.

### Cabbage #2 

Continue to cook the cabbage (and carrots) until it is at a texture that you like. I like a little crunch to my cabbage.

Add the cabbage to your base mixture and go ahead and rinse out the wok and remove everything in there. (Quick rinse in the sink + dry it out with a paper towel - no need for perfection here).

My base mixture looked like this:

### Noodles #3

Hopefully your noodles are done by now. Drain out the water and put them to the side.

## Final Stretch

Take a breath, we are almost done. You should be left with three items: soaked noodles, the "base" mixture, and the pickled veggies.

From here on out, make the mixtures in individual portions.


### For each portion

 1. Get a freshly rinsed wok.
 2. Raise the heat to medium high.
 3. Add in a little bit of vegetable oil.
 4. Scramble two eggs.
 5. Once the wok is hot (smoking), drop in the eggs and whisk vigorously.
 6. Once the eggs are cooked, add in a portions worth of the base mixture, along with a portions worth of rice noodles.
 7. Coat the noodles with the sauce from the base mixture.
 8. Ensure that your meat is fully cooked (in my case, it cooked from sitting in the mixture, but your experience may be different). Take it off the heat once the meat is finished.
 9. Stir in some of the pickled vegetables and serve with fresh cilantro.
 10. Rinse (the wok) and repeat.
